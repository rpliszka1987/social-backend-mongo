## Description

This is an application which demonstrates using Express.js with Mongoose, which allows you to create a backend which saves information into a MongoDB database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database structure which is very different from SQL. In this project I will be creating a connection between the MongoDB and API routes. You are able to to perform CRUD (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete) data from the database.
